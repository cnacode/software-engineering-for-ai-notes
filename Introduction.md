## Sources that impacted the definition of neural networks

1. Functions of eurons in the brain
2. Formal Analysis of propositional logic
3. Turing Theory of computation

## AI is concerned with rational actions given
1. Objectives: AI must have the ability to take actions that are rational or optimal, this requires an objective
2. Interactibility: Ability of an AI system to interact with its environment
  2.1 Allows the system to gather information
  2.2 Respond to change
  2.3 Achieve its goal more effectively
  
  
## Risks of AI
1. Lethal autonomous weapons
2. Surveillance and persuation
3. Biased decision making
4. Cyber attack


## Intelligent Agents

### Agent
1. percieves its environment through sensors
2. acts upon the environment or other agents through actuators
3. have a function that maps percept sequence to an action

Example of agents:
1. Software Agents
2. Robots

### Rational Agent
* Select an action that maximizes its performance measure for each percept sequence
* Has built-in knowledge
